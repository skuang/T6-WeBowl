JS-BSC is a javascript program that calculates a game of bowling for
3 players, or a 3-game series for one player.  It is easily modified
to display and track any number of games.

Features:
-- Shows the player the maximum score that can be achieved if the player 
   were to finish the game with perfect rolls.

-- An interactive pin diagram for each frame shows the pins the player knocked 
   down and left standing after the first ball, and the pins missed on the second ball.
