<h1>How to Use the Bowling Score Calculator</h1>
<p>Enter each player's name(s) or the game number in the Player field.<br />
Then enter your scores in each frame.</p>

<p>You can collapse or expand the introductory text by clicking anywhere on the title text
(the "JavaScript Bowling Score Calculator (JS-BSC)" text). When collapsed, this provides more
room to display the player tables.</p>

<p>The ball entry fields only allow the numbers 0-9. First ball fields also allow an X,
and second ball fields also allow a /.<br />
Entry errors are simply removed, and you need to enter a valid value.</p>

<p>Click on the pin diagram for each frame to toggle the 
pins from "knocked down", to "left standing", to "missed on spare ball"
(by default, all pins are down, so if you get a strike, you don't need to toggle any pins).</p>

<div style="padding-left: 12px; background: #999; border-style: solid; border-width: 2px; border-color: black;">
<p><img src="hit.gif" /> Pin was knocked down</p>
<p><img src="left.gif" /> Pin was not knocked down on first ball</p>
<p><img src="miss.gif" /> Pin was not knocked down (missed) on second ball</p>
</div>

<p>The Clear Values button will clear all fields, including Player Name and pin diagrams.</p>

<p>It is expected that you enter data sequentially,
from frame 1 to frame 10. However the program doesn't verify that you do so, which will cause
an incorrect score calculation. This is corrected by filling in the rest of the frames (in any order,
as long as they are all correctly filled). This is by design, so you have maximum flexibility to
edit/fix scores, and also to score "what-if" games.</p>

<p>Max Score is calculated based on the 
POSTED score, not on actual rolls. So if you have a score of 105 on frame 5, 
but then you get a spare on frame 6, we are still waiting on the results of your
next roll, so the Max Score is calculated based on your score of 105, and doesn't
count the spare you just rolled. You could argue either way, but I've chosen to
calculate based on the actual POSTED score, as your new score is technically still PENDING.</p>

<p>Because BSC is written in javascript, you cannot save what you have inputted,
but you can use your browser's Print function to print a nice chart for your records. If a printer isn't
handy, take a printscreen of the browser (Alt-PrtScr) and save it to your laptop for later printing.</p>

<p>JS-BSC is tested on Firefox and Internet Explorer on Windows, Firefox on Linux, and Safari on Mac OS X.
It should work on other modern graphical browsers as well, but if you have problems, please submit bugs 
(and feature requests) at <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/js-bsc">http://sourceforge.net/projects/js-bsc</a></p>
